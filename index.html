          Drug addiction is a global public health issue that is getting worse. Illegal drug usage has killed many people and had other severe effects on people, especially young adults. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is more potent than other opioids like morphine and heroin, is one of the illegal substances that have just recently come to be recognized as a serious hazard to public health. A significant percentage of overdose deaths worldwide are attributable to fentanyl, and individuals who misuse it suffer very damaging effects on their physical and mental health. The purpose of this thesis website is to examine how fentanyl affects young adults in comparison to other illegal substances.

A sizable percentage of opioid overdose fatalities in recent years have been caused by the substance fentanyl. When the drug started to be combined with other narcotics like heroin and cocaine in the 2010s, it first attracted a lot of attention. The majority of the fentanyl that enters the United States, according to a report by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), is produced in China before being smuggled into the nation using a variety of methods, including shipping and mail services.<br><br>

The drug has been linked to a considerable number of opioid overdose deaths in recent years, according to the research, which emphasizes the effect fentanyl has had on the opioid epidemic in the United States. Drug trafficking organizations find it to be lucrative due to its great potency and inexpensive production.  Disrupting the supply chain and expanding addiction treatment and prevention initiatives have been the main goals of attempts to stop the flow of fentanyl into the country. Despite these initiatives, fentanyl continues to pose a serious problem for law enforcement and public health professionals.

              Fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic painkiller that has 50–100 times the potency of morphine. It was first created in the 1960s to be used as a surgical anesthetic, but it is now frequently used to treat chronic pain and to manage pain in cancer patients. Transdermal patches, lozenges, or injections containing fentanyl are frequently recommended. <br><br>

              Given its high potential for abuse and overdose, fentanyl has, unfortunately, become a real concern. The popularity of illicitly generated fentanyl in drug combinations with heroin and cocaine has increased, which has resulted in a spike in overdose deaths. Another delivery method for fentanyl is in the form of pills and powder, which are frequently sold on the black market alone or in combination with other prescription medications.

            Up to 100 times more strong than morphine, fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid. Although it has the potential to be an effective painkiller for severe cases, it can be fatal in even modest dosages and is highly addictive. The risk of overdose is one of fentanyl's greatest risks. Even a small amount can be fatal, and determining the right dosage can be challenging. Furthermore, the likelihood of an overdose is increased since fentanyl is frequently combined, without the user's knowledge, with other narcotics like heroin or cocaine. Fentanyl use can potentially result in coma, death, and respiratory depression. As a result, it's critical to be aware of the risks associated with fentanyl and to get support if you're having addiction problems.
