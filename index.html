          Drug addiction is a global public health issue that is getting worse. Illegal drug usage has killed many people and had other severe effects on people, especially young adults. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is more potent than other opioids like morphine and heroin, is one of the illegal substances that have just recently come to be recognized as a serious hazard to public health. <br><br>A significant percentage of overdose deaths worldwide are attributable to fentanyl, and individuals who misuse it suffer very damaging effects on their physical and mental health. The purpose of this thesis website is to examine how fentanyl affects young adults in comparison to other illegal substances.<br><br>

A sizable percentage of opioid overdose fatalities in recent years have been caused by the substance fentanyl. When the drug started to be combined with other narcotics like heroin and cocaine in the 2010s, it first attracted a lot of attention.The drug has been linked to a considerable number of opioid overdose deaths in recent years, according to the research, which emphasizes the effect fentanyl has had on the opioid epidemic in the United States. <br><br>The majority of the fentanyl that enters the United States, according to a report by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), is produced in China before being smuggled into the nation using a variety of methods, including shipping and mail services. <br><br>

              Fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic painkiller that has 50–100 times the potency of morphine. It was first created in the 1960s to be used as a surgical anesthetic, but it is now frequently used to treat chronic pain and to manage pain in cancer patients. Transdermal patches, lozenges, or injections containing fentanyl are frequently recommended. <br><br>

              Given its high potential for abuse and overdose, fentanyl has, unfortunately, become a real concern. The popularity of illicitly generated fentanyl in drug combinations with heroin and cocaine has increased, which has resulted in a spike in overdose deaths. Another delivery method for fentanyl is in the form of pills and powder, which are frequently sold on the black market alone or in combination with other prescription medications.

          <!-- The access that our youth have to drugs through social media is astonishing. Apps like snapchat and tiktok have been a huge part of the reason that kids are overdosing on fentanyl. As police say, an alarming portion of fentanyl laced pills are bought through social media. Around 90% of pills that are bought through social media are laced with fentanyl. It is so crucial that young adults using these apps know the dangers of getting drugs through them. According to the DEA, 4 out of 10 pills contain lethal doses of fentanyl. If you or your friends are thinking about obtaining drugs through social media, think twice or the consequences could be severe. Mother of 17 year old Zach who overdosed from laced pills on snapchat, stresses that “this can happen so quickly without your ability to predict. I don't want families to be complacent and think, "it can't happen to us”. <br><br>The opioid epidemic derived from the overprescription of legal pain medications. Opioid medications have become much more accessible as pain treatment than other resources. However, it is also a result from fentanyl being trafficked and supplied by foreign drug cartels. Fentanyl has many socioeconomic consequences on our society and youth. Fentanyl has caused an outburst of health problems such as high rates of hepatitis C, HIV, etc. Newborns that were exposed to drugs in the womb has increased an astonishing 80% from 2010 to 2017, which has no doubt caused the increase of children in foster care. This epidemic has caused a negative pull on our economy and has posed a national security issue. Fentanyl and opioid misuse costs the US around $78 billion every year. In just 2017, the cost of opioid misuse and overdoses cost the US about $1 trillion. In addition, it has been theorized that the opioid epidemic contributed to the decline of labor force participation amongst “prime age workers” by 20% in men, and 25% in women.  -->

<!-- 
            Fentanyl is a major threat to both individual and public health. The frequent use of it primarily affects the CNS, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary systems. Digestive symptoms like nausea, vomiting, constipation, and neurological symptoms like migraines, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, and hallucinations, all are negative effects of fentanyl use. The amount of overdoses raises the concern of how people who are survivors of an overdose are affected by it in the long run. Non fatal fentanyl overdoses allow us to understand the long term effects of opioid overdoses on victims physical, mental, and cognitive functioning. Minor brain injuries can become severe with concussions and hypoxia if overdosing is common among that individual. Respiratory depression and cardiovascular effects are huge risks that come along with overdosing and can have a negative toll on that person for the rest of their life. Chronic brain damage from overdose is associated with physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities among our youth. <br><br>

            Up to 100 times more strong than morphine, fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid. Although it has the potential to be an effective painkiller for severe cases, it can be fatal in even modest dosages and is highly addictive. The risk of overdose is one of fentanyl's greatest risks. Even a small amount can be fatal, and determining the right dosage can be challenging. Furthermore, the likelihood of an overdose is increased since fentanyl is frequently combined, without the user's knowledge, with other narcotics like heroin or cocaine. Fentanyl use can potentially result in coma, death, and respiratory depression. As a result, it's critical to be aware of the risks associated with fentanyl and to get support if you're having addiction problems.             -->

              It is important to understand the signs of an overdose and when it is appropriate to use Narcan. 

              Narcan should be given to an individual that shows signs of an opioid overdose or when it is expected. The only FDA approved methods of using it for overdoses are using it as nasal spray or injecting it into the muscles, under the skin, or into the veins. Naloxone only works in the body for 30 to 90 minutes, so keep in mind that this is a quick remedy to an overdose. Overdoses have to be treated properly after narcan use, as it's possible for a person to still experience the effects of an overdose. People who are given naloxone need to be monitored another two hours after their last dose to make sure their breathing does not slow or stop.

              Fentanyl addiction treatments can include medications and counseling. Medications for opioid use disorders are effective and save lives. Methadone and Buprenorphine both attach to and activate opioid receptors to ease the withdrawal symptoms and craving. Behavioral therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy, helps people to modify their attitudes and behaviors towards drug use, increase healthy life skills and a healthy lifestyle, and will help these individuals that are struggling with their medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps people recovering to manage their triggers and stress. <br><br>
